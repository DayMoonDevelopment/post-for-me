Media are media assets (images, videos, etc.) that can be attached to posts using the media url. These endpoints are only needed if your media is not already available on a publicly accessible URL.
Media assets are stored temporarily and are automatically deleted in the following scenarios:
- When the associated post is published
- After 24 hours if not attached to any post
- When the scheduled post is deleted
