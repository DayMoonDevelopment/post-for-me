  },
  {
    question: "Are there hard rate limits?",
    answer:
      "We do not limit account connections nor seat caps for the dashboard. Throughput is governed only by the social networks' own limits.",
  },

      "All you need to do is get app credentials from the social platform and we handle the rest. This ensures when users connect their accounts they see your brand and ultimately allows you to own the connections",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Do I need to go through app approval on TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, etc.?",
    answer:
      "Nope! You can use our crendetials and skip the verification process. If you use your own app credentials then each app will need to go through approval before going live. We are to help! Contact us any time to walk you through the approval process.",
  },
  {

  },
  {
    question: "How do I get started?",
    answer:
      "Getting started is simple. Signup for an account, plug in your App credentials OR use ours, create an API key, and then start posting!",
